// the router, next to the path it protects: one line per route, and a reviewer
// can read the whole service's access policy without opening a controller.

// request.auth.capabilities is filled by `authenticate` from the DB matrix — the
// same list the browser gets on /auth/me, which is what keeps a rendered control
// and the call behind it from disagreeing.
//
// Fails CLOSED. A key with no grant row denies everyone, so adding a capability
// to code before seeding it locks the feature rather than opening it.
